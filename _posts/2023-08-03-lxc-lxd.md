# Introduction

In order to get a clean working environment, you should develop and test your systems in containerized environments. Multiple solutions exist such as LXD, Docker, CRI-O, Podman which all enables users to run applications in isolated containers.

Container stack (__information that need to be confirmed__):
- Docker:
    Docker > containerd > (+shim) -(OCI spec)-> runC > LXC > cgroups/namespaces
- CRI-O:
    Kubernetes -(CRI API)-> CRI-O -(OCI spec)-> runC > LXC > cgroups/namespaces
- LXD:
    LXD > LXC > cgroups/namespaces

*FYI: runC is written in Go and LXD in written in C*

Here I will present LXD, an open-source solution maintained by [Canonical][lxd-website]. LXD is a system daemon that provides an interface ([REST API][lxd-rest-api]) used to manage and connect to an LXC container through `liblxc` library, while being responsible for handling networking, data storage, and managing multiple LXC containers. (LXC can run as a standalone tool but it is somehow limited.)

LXD is mostly adapted to system containers (as opposed to Docker which is mostly adapted to application container).

# Installation

On an Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS OS, run:

```bash
lxd init
```

Follow the instruction (default value should are fine but I personally enables network access to the containers).

Launch a new ubuntu container:
```bash
lxc launch images:ubuntu/jammy u1 #add "-p myProfile" for a specific profile
```

Check instantiated containers state:
```bash
lxc list
```

You also might want to create `ufw` rules to allow LXD bridge interface:
```bash
sudo ufw allow in on lxdbr0
sudo ufw route allow in on lxdbr0 
sudo ufw reload
```

# Images

The list of available images hosted on `images:` is presented on: [https://images.linuxcontainers.org/](https://images.linuxcontainers.org/)

or by running:
```bash
lxc image list images:
```

And local images are listed with:
```bash
lxc image list
```

To get an Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur image locally from `images:` (an set it with `ubuntu2310` alias), run:
```bash
lxc image copy images:ubuntu/mantic local: --alias ubuntu2310
```

To export an image to a `.tar.gz`:
```bash
lxs image export myimage .
```
You can also explore the image:
```bash
tar -xzvf <xxxxxxxx>.tar.gz
```
Edit it and (especially templates and rootfs) and regenerate the archive:
```bash
tar -czvf import.tar.gz *
```

Then import the tunned image into your `local:` images:
```bash
lxc image import import.tar.gz --alias tunedImage
```

# Containers

Containers are instantiated images.

## info
To get information relatives to a container:
```bash
lxc info u1
```

## start

To start a container, simply run:
```bash
lxc start u1
```

## exec
When in a running status you can interact with containers:
```bash
lxc exec u1 -- sh
```

## file sharing
To send files to a container:

```bash
lxc file push file_to_push.txt u1/path/in/container/
```

To receive a file from the container:
```bash
lxc file pull u1/path/to/file_to_pull.txt /tmp/
```

To mount a shared directory between host system and the container:

```bash
lxc config device add u1 u1dev disk source=/tmp/ path=/host/tmp 
```

This mount `/tmp/` host directory onto `/host/tmp/` folder of the container.

## snapshot
To take a snapshot of a container:
```bash
lxc snapshot u1 backup1
```

*snapshots list is available with `lxc info u1`*

To restore a snapshot:
```bash
lxc restore u1 backup1
```

## stop
To set the container with stopped status:
```bash
lxc stop u1
```

## copy
To copy a container with stopped status:
```bash
lxc copy u1 u1Copy # with -f option to stop at the same time
```

## publish
To turn a container (or a snapshot) onto an image:
```bash
lxc publish u1 --alias u1Published # with -f option to stop at the same time (and relaunch it is it was running)
```

## delete
When a container is stopped, you can delete the container:
```bash
lxc delete u1 # with -f option to stop at the same time (delete while running)
```

## exposing container port to the outside world

To route specific port 80 from a container to the outside 8888 port:

```bash
lxc config device add u1 myPort80ProxyDevice proxy listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:8888 connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:80
```

# LXD/LXC remote access

Check the configuration on the server you can to remotely access:

```bash
lxc config edit
```

*You can set `export EDITOR=vim` (even in your `.profile`) to use vim instead of nano.*

List remote systems on the client:
```bash
lxc remote list
```

Add a new remote (corresponding to the server) on the client:

```bash
lxc remote add myRemote <ip_address>:<port(8443)> --password <password>
```

List containers running on the remote:
```bash
lxc list myRemote:
```

List images hosted on the remote:
```bash
lxc image list myRemote:
```

Previous commands in the part about containers and images should work with `myRemote:`.

# Storage

## list existing storage pools

```bash
lxc storage list
```

## get storage pool information

```bash
lxc storage show myStorage
```

## create a new storage pool

```bash
lxc storage create myStorage dir source=/home/user/storage
```

# Profile

## list existing profiles

```bash
lxc profile list
```

## create and edit a new profile

```bash
lxc profile create myProfile
lxc profile edit myProfile
```

## change container profile
```bash
lxc profile remove u1 default 
lxc profile assign u1 myProfile
```
